Thank you guys, you did an amazing job!

The main functions of the helmet are the following:
- Signaling the intention of changing the direction (left, right, brake) via remote joystick on the handle and displaying on a LED matrix on the back of the helmet.
- Detecting accident via accelerometer
- Smart headlight - turns on when it's dark
- GPS tracking
